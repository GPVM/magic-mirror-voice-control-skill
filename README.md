# Magic Mirror Voice Control skill
Voice commands to Mycroft to control a Magic Mirror using the MMM-Remote-Control module.

## Description
This mycroft skill passes commands to a MagicMirror installed on a Raspberry Pi. It requires a working install of MagicMirror[MagicMirror](https://github.com/MichMich/MagicMirror) and the [MMM-Remote-Control module](https://github.com/Jopyth/MMM-Remote-Control) must be installed.

MYCROFT MUST BE INSTALLED AND WORKING ON THE SAME RASPBERRY PI.

This skill requires MMM-Remote-Control be installed and working properly.
You can use this skill to hide or show modules, update the mirror or individual modules,
refresh or restart the mirror, list installed modules, install modules by name (will still require you
to configure the MagicMirror config.js by SSH or VNC), change pages of modules by either swipe commands
or telling mycroft to "go to page [number]"(requires that [MMM-pages](https://github.com/edward-shen/MMM-pages)
be installed), restart or reboot the Raspberry Pi.

MMM-Remote-Control requires the module identifier to know which module to
perform ModuleActionKeywords on (HIDE|SHOW) for example. This skill parses the MODULE_DATA returned from
the MMM-Remote-Control and compares it to the file "AvailableModules.json"
It then creates another file called file "AvailableModulesWithIdentifier.json"
to store the module identifier that matches the ModuleKeywords. Modules identifiers may change
depending on their order in the MagicMirror config.js file. Everytime you install a new module
the module identifiers may change. If you run into issues, restart MagicMirror and Mycroft,
and this skill should update the changed module identifiers. Just be aware after installing new modules
and updating the config.js file that voice commands may not work properly until you restart both
MagicMirror and Mycroft.

To match what Mycroft hears to a module, for instance a user would say
'weather' but if MMM-WunderGround is installed and displayed, it would be considered the "weather" module.
These adjustments are made by changing the "mycroftname" in the file "AvailableModules.json"
For example: search for "weather" in the file "AvailableModules.json" and change it's
mycroftname to something other than weather like 'weather old' or 'current weather'.
Then search for MMM-Wunderground and change it's mycroftname to 'weather'. The change must be
to a module name that is also reflected in the ModuleKeywords.voc otherwise mycroft will not recognize the name.
For your changes to persist all modifications should be made to the file "AvailableModules.json"

The way this skill works is by requests.get(url,params) sending a get request to the MMM-Remote-Control module via
url for example 'http://localhost:8080/remote?action=someaction&param=someparameter'

This skill includes intents for 90% of what the MMM-Remote-Control module is capable of doing. The other 10% is a work in progress.

## Examples
* "Hey Mycroft: hide clock"
* "show clock"
* "turn on weather"
* "turn off weather"
* "show [insert module name]"
* "hide [insert module name]"
* "update mirror"
* "update [insert module name]"
* "restart pi"
* "restart mirror"
* "refresh mirror"
* "reboot raspberry pi"
* "show article details" (for news feed)
* "hide article details"
* "swipe left" (requires pages module to be installed)
* "swipe right" (requires pages module to be installed)
* "list installed modules" (Mycroft will tell you which MagicMirror modules are installed)

## To do list
* set up send notifications to mirror
* create Mycroft specific MagicMirror module
